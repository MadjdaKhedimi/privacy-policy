# Research Tracker - Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy page for the Research Tracker Chrome extension. It's hosted on GitHub Pages so users can read about how we handle their data.

## What's in here

Just the privacy policy HTML page that explains:
- What data the extension collects (spoiler: none, everything's local)
- How the extension works
- What permissions it needs and why
- User rights and data control

## Why a separate repo

I wanted to keep the privacy policy separate from the main extension code, and GitHub Pages makes it easy to host a simple static page.

## Live page

The privacy policy is live at: [https://madjdakhedimi.github.io/research-tracker/](https://madjdakhedimi.github.io/privacy-policy/)

## About Research Tracker

Research Tracker is a Chrome extension that helps researchers save papers, track deadlines, and find relevant journals/conferences. Everything runs locally in your browser - no data collection, no tracking.
